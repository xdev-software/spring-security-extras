# Extras for Spring Security (SSE)

This framework provides various modules which make it easier and safer to create or manage various security solution in Spring apps, especially in distributed systems.<br/>
It adds features like remembering the userâ€™s last identity provider, automatic logout checks, improved OAuth2/OIDC management, smoother frontend integration and remembering the login after a server restart.<br/>
It also secures system endpoints, avoids unnecessary sessions and comes with built-in metrics.

Nearly everything can be overridden with a custom implementation or disabled if required.
